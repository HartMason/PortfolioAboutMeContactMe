            <p>I was born in Austin, Texas in 1989. Austin has been home for two decades but I have also lived in Arizona, California, Colorado, and Oregon. The best part of traveling across this country was being exposed to interesting people and cultures. I feel very greatful for all the opportunities that have been given to me. Most of my career has been spent doing manual labor. I have worked as an electrician, landscaper, sign manufacturer, and arborist. I have always loved computers and been facinated about how they work. I decided to save up money for Austin Coding Academy so they could train me at this new exciting career in software development.
